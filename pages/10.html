        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">everyone around me has a thing</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">noel has her game and flux has their everything</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i follow so many people online who make such impressive art</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">and i have nothing despite so desperately wanting</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">maybe noel was right, maybe it is clinical</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">but what if it isn't</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">what if i'm able to get on antidepressants and they don't fix me</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">what then?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">do i just say 'welp guess i'm fucked, time to kill myself?'</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">hey, no talk of killing ourselves</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">yeah but you get my point</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i'll never have what i want so what else is there</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i've been supporting my friends for so long and i feel like there's not much i recieve back</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">noel just set up a conversation with flux for us so we could talk about writing</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">they wrote up a lot and took time out of their day to help us</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">they're clearly trying to support us</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">ughhhhh you're fucking right but i want to complain</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">is that my problem? do i just blame everything on everyone else?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i should stop talking to them i don't want them to feel bad</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">isolating ourself isn't good either</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">we don't really vocalize this blame even if we feel it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">would it be nice if they tried to push us more? yeah</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">but that's not their job</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">flux was right, we need to learn how to do things for ourself</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">relying on the force of others would kinda ruin that</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i know you're right but it's just so tiring to do things on my own</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't get pleasure from doing any of it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">do i even really want this?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">why do i want to write, why do i want to do anything?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">if it's just to connect with others then what's the difference between that and relying on people?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">ideally we'd get some sort of personal satisfaction from the process of creation</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">which brings it back to something clinical</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">and me wanting to kill myself</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">we don't want to kill ourself</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">it just feels like the only out</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i know the easy out isn't the best but the hard way has been killing me slowly for years anyway</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">why not just take it into my own hands?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">we have so much potential to do great things</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">and we've wasted so fucking much of it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">why do i have to do something great?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">why do i have this intense need to be important on some grand scale?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">can't i be happy that i've touched the lives of my friends?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i can't, and i'll only get more unhappy as i go on</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">we need to see a psychiatrist</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">therapy hasn't been working, why would a drug?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">i don't know. i don't fucking know</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">i just don't want to die. please. can you fucking sympathize with your own self?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl right">i don't want to die. you don't want to die. i don't fucking know</p>
