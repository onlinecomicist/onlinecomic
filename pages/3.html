        <p class="maninthelight spoken left">He said he was too tired, so he's not gonna eat.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">oh</p>
        <p class="maninthelight spoken left">He really has to stop working nights. Especially when it starts getting dark at like 5.</p>
        <p class="maninthelight spoken left">I barely even see my husband anymore.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">yeah it sucks</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">what're we eating</p>
        <p class="maninthelight spoken left">I figured you wouldn't pick anything so I just cut up a cucumber and some carrots and threw them in a bowl of lettuce. 
            I'm making some grilled chicken now, if you want to just start with the plain salad.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">okay thank you</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">‎</p>

        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">‎</p>
        <p class="maninthelight spoken left">You know my work son, right? That guy Ernest? The one they all say looks like me.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">yeah, you've mentioned him</p>
        <p class="maninthelight spoken left">He's only a few years older than you, he took a couple gap years to take care of his mom and now he goes to a community college. 
            He wants to be like an engineer or something. Marissa came into the back when he was telling me and snickered a bit, I think that embarassed him.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">wow</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">hope he gets in</p>
