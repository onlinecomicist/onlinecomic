        <p class="onlinefriend right">Omg i forgot the best part of petrichor!!</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">The creators like released a soundtrack to go along with it and like, each song has a specific moment to be played at</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">I can't believe i almost forgot that part</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">I'll send you the album later, it's on bandcamp</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">‎</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">hey i'm back</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Hihi!</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">How was dinner? What'd you have?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">it was alright, i had a salad with grilled chicken</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Ooooh nice!</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">have you eaten yet</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Nah it's still too early to eat</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">ah okay</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Did you see what i sent about the petrichor soundtrack?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">oh wow yeah that's really cool</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't think i'll be able to get to it tonight though</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Awwwh that's okay!</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Got anything going on tonight?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">not really</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">unless you count rotting in your room as something</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't understand how i do nothing all day and yet i'm still too tired to do something simple like read a story</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">I mean maybe it's something clinical?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't know if that would make me worry less or more</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">What do you mean?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i dunno, getting into it is like a whole thing</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i feel bad for dumping all this on you</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">especially considering you never really come to me with stuff like this of your own</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't want you to like, feel as if i'm taking advantage of you</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Hey</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">but i also don't want you to think that like, you SHOULD have more issues to talk about</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Hey hey stop typing for a sec</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i mean they're not really issues like i can deal with them they're fine</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">shit sorry</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">You're fine!</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">fuck i'm sorry for going on about that</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Listennnn!!!</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">You're okay!</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Everything is alright!</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">First of all, i wouldn't have asked what you meant if i wasn't fine with talking to you about this</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Secondly, i've told you so many times in the past that i'm free whenever to talk, especially about important things</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">And you always say the same too! And i feel comfortable sharing that all with you, i just, i don't know</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">It's difficult for me</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">I know you always say it's difficult for you to express emotions but you're, like, constantly showing an emotion</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">There's so much to read into for you, and i get a little upset sometimes when you say that</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">But that's a whole different thing i don't want to take away from this</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">aw shit i'm sorry i didn't know you felt that way</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Don't! Apologize! You're just expressing how you feel, and even if it doesn't necessarily reflect reality it still reflects your reality</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">With that being said, go ahead and talk about what you were going to talk about</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">well now it's like a whole thing and i feel awkward and bad</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">You'd better tell me what's bothering you right now or i'll post every blackmail screenshot of you i have</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">ughhh you are the fucking worst</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">okay just let me breathe for a bit and i'll tell you</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">>:)</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">‎</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">That was a joke btw</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">You know i'd never</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">‎</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">noel, i know</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">mainly because i have way worse screenshots of you that i'd be able to post</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">thank you for caring so aggressively</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">Awwh it's no worry</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">So what's going on?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i just feel unoriginal</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">which i know is like, fine</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">every work is derivative of another, yeah yeah</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">but it feels different for me</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i feel like i couldn've done so much with what i had, and that i wasted it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i know there's some great work inside me, like i'm a slab of marble</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i just don't feel like chipping away at it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">and i guess it's not like i 'don't feel like it'</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">there's something more that i can't explain</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i remember reading this thing online that was like 'straight men all think they could land a plane with no practice'</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">and there were so many more examples about men just being filled with hubris</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">is that just me? is my yearning to be able to create a great work of art and genuinely beliving that i could if i just did it for a couple hours 
            just an extension of that base masculine arrogance?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">am i still just a man?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">in middle school i was an asshole</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">everyone was, so i guess i don't really blame myself</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">but later on i heard that everyone used to think i was arrogant then</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">which, above all, scared me</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">it took me completely by surprise, how could i be arrogant when i feel so tiny? when i want to flatten myself against a wall and disappear?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">it's just been digging away at my mind for so long</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i feel like i should be a god</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">like i should be able to do so much, use my time in valuable ways</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't need sleep, i'm above my body, i don't feel pain, i don't need to eat</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i should be a machine. i already feel like a machine</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">nothing brings me genuine joy, or maybe it does and i just don't know it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">if i have felt joy it's not easily repeatable</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">there's nothing i can turn to as a constant source of good feelings and energy</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i just need the nothingness, being able to turn my brain off</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">but when i turn my brain off i can't create</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i have no energy ever</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">do i? am i not pushing myself hard enough?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">if i push myself any harder i fear i'll crack</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">it's too painful to push now</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i need someone to push me</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i need to be beaten and broken</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i can't carry on under my own power anymore</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">is any of this even coherent? is this too concerning?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i'm sorry, i don't even know what you could possibly even respond to this with</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i'm so sorry for putting you in this awkward of a position</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">fuck i'm so sorry</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">‎</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">‎</p>
        <p class="onlinefriend right">I love you</p>
