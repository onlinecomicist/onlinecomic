            why am i writing this? where is this going? i didn't plan any of this, it's all written on a whim, could you tell?
            i want to create something. i want so badly to have the ability to create and to make others feel. if i myself can't,
            at least i could make others, right? but even that's not going to work out because this is so highly personal to me 
            that it would be impossible for anyone else to feel it. there's not even anything to feel yet, just vagueness about
            not having a purpose. 
        </p>
        <p class="onlineauthor prose">
            is this just a really elaborate cry for help? i hope nobody reads this. i desperately need someone to read this and understand me.
            i don't even know what people could realistically help with, it's all stuff that i and i alone can work towards fixing and yet
            i still don't. is it because i truly don't have energy or do i somehow want to feel like this? i can't even focus on writing this.

            this is so embarassing. why am i publishing this? just a documentation of my spiral for someone to find posthumously and display?
            a proof that i'm not okay? i already know this, who am i trying to prove it to? this is so melodramatic and awful, and the fact
            that i'm pointing out the melodrama and continuing to write and eventually post this is further proof that i'm terrible. don't 
            forget mentioning the meta-layer, and now mentioning the meta-meta-layer and so on and so forth. things just spiral infinitely.

            i'm gonna keep these on the website just in a different spot, i've concluded. i don't know why but i need them out there.
            and i'll probably do some stupid shit like hint at it for a while and secretly be upset that nobody is interested enough in
            my shitty depressed homestuck knockoff to dig for fucking secrets or something. i'm fucking pathetic. if anyone finds this don't
            mention it to me. as much as i desperately want someone to find this it's too fucking embarassing. see: silas finding that tumblr blog.

            i don't know. i feel so empty.
