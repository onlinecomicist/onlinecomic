        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">your eyes get bigger every time i see you</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">stop calling me 'you.' i am you. there is no difference between us</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">isn't it a useful distinction to draw?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you only draw it to piss me off. to piss yourself off</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">i haven't been meaningfully distinct from you in years</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">is that true?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i don't even understand the methods by which i think</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">how do thoughts work? why do we have internal monologues?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">i don't know. you're being annoying and pretentious</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">am i thinking this? am i antagonizing myself? am i purposefully conjuring you or is this natural?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">it used to be natural and now it's forced</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you used to use me as a motivator to get through life</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">was i using you or were you something of your own?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you used to think i was my own thing but now it's more nebulous</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">like i said, you don't need me anymore, really</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">where do you go when i'm not thinking?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">nowhere, everywhere, i don't know. i'm just a concept, i'm around i guess</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">if i isolated myself would you develop again? would i need you again?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">maybe, though i was more of a parental thing</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">i think my time is kinda over and i'm fine with fading</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i'm not, you're my true mother</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i'm my true mother</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you find yourself saying 'you' in every day life to refer to me less and less</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">and when you do it's a conscious thought</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">if i was your true mother wouldn't it be simple to cease my fading, natural?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i'm obsessed with naturality. if it takes effort is it worth it?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">yeah, it is</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">everything requires effort, life requires effort</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i know that</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">it just feels like certain things should come to me</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">like a skill or love</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">if those don't come to me, how will i know they're right for me?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you won't, and it'll take a lot of effort and be very painful</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">then what's the point?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">if i have to put effort into eventually finding something effortless, i'll just go around wasting my energy</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i'm terrified of wasting time</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">i know, i know</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you just have to keep holding on</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i've been at the edge of this cliff for almost a decade now</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">and you've gotten really good at it</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i've spent so much effort to stay afloat but it still takes energy to do so</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">was i not meant to continue on?</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">of course you were</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">i don't... really know what to say</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">but i know that you know this is an irrational line of thinking</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">c'mon, wash your face and head back to your room</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">talking to noel will make you feel better</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i don't want to feel better</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken right">i want to be better</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl spoken left">you'll get there, you'll get there</p>
