        <p class="flux right">Yo. Heard from Noel you want to learn how to write. I haven't written in a while, but I think I could give you some tips. Send 
            something over that you're proud of when you get the chance. Or we could just brainstorm if you want, your call.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">‎</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">hey flux</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">thanks for reaching out</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't really have anything yet</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i want to write i just don't know how or even why, really</p>
        <p class="flux right">That's chill. It's difficult trying to help someone out who doesn't know why they even want to do the thing they need help with, but it's cool. 
            Do you enjoy writing? Noel told me last night that you were working on something, what was that like? I'll read it if you send it.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">i'd rather not</p>
        <p class="flux right">No worries.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">writing is like fine though</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">it was pretty difficult to write last night but i think that's like normal</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">my motivation crashed pretty fast though</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">like i got the feeling i wanted to write and put my fingers to my screen and immediately it was sapped from me</p>
        <p class="flux right">Hm. Sometimes for me it's worthwhile to not write things down right away. I know it might seem smart to strike while the iron's hot and you have
            the motivation, but personally developing my ideas in my head first often leads to better outcomes. I'll think of the hook or chorus of a song but if I write those
            down on their own it feels like I'm assembling a puzzle later on as opposed to letting it become it's own thing in my mind and getting that all down at once. Writing 
            being difficult though is definitely its own thing. There's a level of difficulty that's normal when starting something new and you shouldn't let that stop you, but
            I also get that you wouldn't want to waste your time. I know it sucks hearing this but you genuinely do just have to try it for a while. If you want to stick with it
            I can try to help somehow, but as a warning I don't really get motivated to do things. Creating is my outlet and I don't think about it as anything, so I might not 
            be the best to learn from.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">how did you get like that though</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">there had to be some point where you were like me and you felt like it was impossible</p>
        <p class="flux right">Honestly? Not really. My parents put me in piano lessons when I was young so it became something I had to do. My elementary school offered surprisingly
            competent art classes and I don't really aspire to be more than pretty alright. My mom's a writer, she'd always tell me so much about her job and show me the transcripts
            she was editing. I'm not incredible at any of these things but I don't really want to. I'm content where I am, my life is pretty chill.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">so because i didn't do anything as a kid i'm just fucked?</p>
        <p class="flux right">Nope, you're deliberately mischaracterizing what I said. I'm not a paragon of excellence or a standard to meet. I'm one person out of billions and you don't
            have to be me. You can't be me. You have to be you and that can mean so many things. Do you want to write because that'll make you into someone that you'd love? Or do you
            genuinely want to write? You don't have to know now but it's important to do things for the right reasons. Give me a pros and cons list of becoming a writer.</p>
        <p class="onlinegirl left">well like now it's going to sound stupid because you went on about doing it for myself</p>
        <p class="flux right">Exactly. It's important to note though that you could want to do something to become someone else and to become yourself at the same time, it's just worth
            teasing apart which aspects of it come from which. Do you want to become rich and famous? Clearly something drew you to writing specifically, rather than say art or music,
            so maybe there is some buried enjoyment there. Do you like to see your friends' reactions to what you write? Do you want to affect people? These aren't bad things at all,
            it's all just a sliding scale. Is it worth it to slog through something you hate for the validation and appreciation of others? If so, how much can you endure? How do you 
            know you truly hate doing something? Do you want to be something? Do you want to feel whole?</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">‎</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">i don't know</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">it's overwhelming to think about</p>
            <p class="flux right">I think a good indicator to know whether or not you're doing it for external or internal gain is if you do it on your own for fun or as an outlet or
                as a vent. Try writing something on your own. Don't sit down now and force something out, but next time an idea comes to you try not to think about how your friends will react
                and just write for your own sake.</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">how will i improve if nobody critiques me though</p>
            <p class="flux right">It seems like you're already your own worse critic, so I'm sure you'll have a lot to say about your own work. Plus if you're enjoying writing or using it
                to process emotions, it doesn't have to be technically sound, creative work, it can be whatever.</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">i guess so</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">it just sucks to be behind</p>
            <p class="flux right">You're only going to be more behind if you keep getting caught up in your own head.</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">true</p>
            <p class="onlinegirl left">thanks flux</p>
            <p class="flux right">No worries.</p>
